This file is part of my Coursera Module 6 assigment.  It is regarding Data Science Tools and Ecosystem, where I provide examples of commonly used languages, tools, libraries, and demonstrate a few commonly used instructions with markdown cells.
Some of these instructions would be how to crreate headings with "#", demonstrating bold fonts, bulleted lists, and column creation.
